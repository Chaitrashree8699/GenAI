Virtual Literature Review Generator — Multi-Agent LLM system

Virtual Literature Review Generator — Multi-Agent LLM system (Autogen + LLaMA 3.3 via Groq + Streamlit)
Short summary: This repository implements a multi-agent generative AI system that automates literature retrieval, summarization, and review. Multiple LLM-based agents each perform a role (researcher, summarizer, reviewer) and cooperate to produce vetted literature summaries. The project includes a Streamlit UI, data retrieval from ArXiv/Google Scholar, and example notebooks / documentation.
